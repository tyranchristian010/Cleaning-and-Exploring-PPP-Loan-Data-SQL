# Cleaning-and-Exploring-PPP-Loan-Data-SQL
Exploratory analyses and data wrangling conducted on a PPP Loan dataset containing information on over 10 million approved borrowers. Using SQL Integration Services (SSIS), I imported the data, performed CTEs, joins, and window functions to gain insight, and then visualized the results using Tableau.

At one point in time, the Small Business Administration (SBA) had kept their Paycheck Protection Loan data private. But in 2020, a court order changed that. Judge James Boasberg ordered the SBA to release all the information about the loans given to private companies under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This meant that the public would finally get to see the names, addresses, and exact loan amounts of all the PPP and EIDL borrowers.
This project involves taking this newly released data and transforming it into insights. We use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to transfer theÂ .csv files into a SQL Server database. Then, we clean and prepare the data for analysis. Finally, we use SQL to explore the imported data and gain valuable insights. It's like turning a pile of raw data into a goldmine of information.
